1. In the project directory, execute make clean (to be safe), followed by make.
2. If you would like to see the run time of the memory manager and malloc, please run the following: ./main_mm followed by ./main_malloc.
3. To run the sender/receiver please first execute ./packet_sender <num_messages>. Then, in a separate shell, execute ./packet_receiver <num_messages>.
   Note: num_messages must be the same for both commands, otherwise the program may have a nondeterministic behavior.
4. This program uses a simple memory manager to allocate memory for a messages. It transmits the messages in packets and assembles them in the correct sequence to print the final, received message.
5. All three of us implemented the project in its entirety. The reason of this is because we each wanted the learning experience of completing all of the requirements. The final submitted version is an amalgam of our individual work.
